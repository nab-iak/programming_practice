# Practice for R language
All the questions are from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

# 1. Convert a Number to a String! <a name="prob1"></a>
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?
Examples (input --> output):

```
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```

**Solutions:**

```r
number_to_string <- function(n) {
  as.character(n)
}
```

# 2. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'<a name="prob2"></a>
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a `"Yes"` string for `true`, or a `"No"` string for `false`.

**Solutions:**

```r
bool_to_word <- function(bool){
  return(ifelse(bool,"Yes","No"))
}
```

# 3. Are You Playing Banjo? <a name="prob3"></a>
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
```

**Solution:**

```r
are_you_playing_banjo <- function(name){
 return(
   ifelse(
   substring(name,1,1) %in% c("R","r"),
   paste(name, "plays banjo", sep=" "),
   paste(name, "does not play banjo", sep=" "))
 )
}
```

# 4. Sum Arrays <a name="prob4"></a>
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

**Examples**
Input: `[1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]`  
Output: `9.2`

Input: `[]`  
Output: `0`

Input: `[-2.398]`  
Output: `-2.398`

**Assumptions**
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.

**What We're Testing**
We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.
Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

**Solution:**
```r
sum_array <- function(a){
  sum(a)
}
```

# 5. Euler's method for a first-order ODE <a name="prob5"></a>
We want to calculate the shape of an unknown curve which starts at a given point with a given slope. This curve satisfies an ordinary differential equation (ODE):

$$
\frac{d_y}{d_x}=f(x,y);\\
y(x_0)=y_0
$$

The starting point $A_0(x_0,y_0)$ is known as well as the slope to the curve at $A_0$​ and then the tangent line at $A_0$.

Take a small step along that tangent line up to a point $A_1$. Along this small step, the slope does not change too much, so $A_1$ will be close to the curve. If we suppose that $A_1$ is close enough to the curve, the same reasoning as for the point $A_1$ ​ above can be used for other points. After several steps, a polygonal curve $A_0$, $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ is computed. The error between the two curves will be small if the step is small.

We define points $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$​ whose x-coordinates are $x_0$, $x_1$, ..., $x_n$​ and y-coordinates are such that $y_{k+1}=y_k+f(x_k,y_k) \times h$ where $h$ is the common step. If $T$ is the length $x_n-x_0$ we have $h=T/n$.

**Task**
For this kata we will focus on the following differential equation:

$$
\frac{d_y}{d_x}=2-e^{-4x}-2y;\\
A_0=(0,1)
$$

The starting point $A_0(x_0,y_0)$ is known as well as the slope to the curve at $A_0$ and then the tangent line at $A_0$.

with $x∈[0,1]$. We will then take a uniform partition of the region of $x$ between $0$ and $1$ and split it into $n$ sections (hence $n+1$ points). $n$ will be the input to the function `ex_euler(n)` and since $T$ is always 1, $h=1/n$.

We know that an exact solution is

$$
z=1+0.5e^{-4x}-0.5e^{-2x}
$$

For each $x_k$ we are able to calculate the $y_k$ as well as the values $z_k​ of the exact solution.

Our task is, for a given number $n$ of steps, to return the mean (truncated to 6 decimal places) of the relative errors between the $y_k$​ (our aproximation) and the $z_k$ (the exact solution). For that we can use:

error in $A_k=abs(y_k-z_k)/z_k$​ and then the mean is sum(errors in $A_k$)/(n+1)​

**Examples**

```
ex_euler(10) should return: 0.026314 (truncated from 0.026314433214799246)
with
Y = [1.0,0.9..., 0.85..., 0.83..., 0.83..., 0.85..., 0.86..., 0.88..., 0.90..., 0.91..., 0.93...]
Z = [1.0, 0.9..., 0.88..., 0.87..., 0.87..., 0.88..., 0.89..., 0.90..., 0.91..., 0.93..., 0.94...]
Relative errors = [0.0, 0.02..., 0.04..., 0.04..., 0.04..., 0.03..., 0.03..., 0.02..., 0.01..., 0.01..., 0.01...]
```

`ex_euler(17)` should `return: 0.015193 (truncated from 0.015193336263370796)`. As expected, as $n$ increases, our error reduces.

Thanks to @rge123 for a better description

**Solution:**
```r
exEuler <- function(nb) {
  # Information from instructions
  x0 <- 0; y0 <- 1; T <- 1; h <- T/nb
  # Define function dt/dx=f1, and z=f2
  f1 <- function(x,y) 2-exp(-4*x)-2*y
  f2 <- function(x) 1+0.5*exp(-4*x)-0.5*exp(-2*x)
  
  # The 1st element in y
  y <- y0
  for (i in 1:nb){
    y[1+i] <- y[i] + f1((i-1)*h,y[i])*h
  }
  
  # The 1st element in z
  z <- f2(x0)
  for (i in 2:(nb+1)){
    z[i] <- f2((i-1)*h)
  }
  
  # Calculate error in A_k according to the given formula
  Aerror <- abs(y-z)/z
  
  # Return the result
  return(sum(Aerror)/(nb+1))
}
```

*Note*
- **The point** in this problem is not understanding the background introductions, but is using given formula to calculate `y` and `z`. 
- There is **no need** to understand what the Euler's method for a first-order ODE is.

**The better solutions:**
```r
# by @bacti
exEuler <- function(n) {
    f <- function(x) 1 + 0.5 * exp(-4 * x) - 0.5 * exp(-2 * x)
    est <- function(x, y) y + (2 - exp(-4 * x) - 2 * y) * h
    h <- 1 / n
    x <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = h)
    y <- purrr::accumulate(head(x, n), function(y, x) est(x, y), .init = 1)
    z <- f(x)
    signif(sum(abs(y - z) / z) / (n + 1), digits = 6)
}
```

# 6. Birthday II - Presents <a name="prob6"></a>
Your colleagues have been good enough(?) to buy you a birthday gift. Even though it is your birthday and not theirs, they have decided to play pass the parcel with it so that everyone has an even chance of winning. There are multiple presents, and you will receive one, but not all are nice... One even explodes and covers you in soil... strange office. To make up for this one present is a dog! Happy days! (do not buy dogs as presents, and if you do, never wrap them).

Depending on the number of passes in the game (y), and the present you unwrap (x), return as follows:

`x == goodpresent` --> return x with num of passes added to each charCode (turn to charCode, add y to each, turn back)

`x == crap || x == empty` --> return string sorted alphabetically

`x == bang` --> return string turned to char codes, each code reduced by number of passes and summed to a single figure

`x == badpresent` --> return 'Take this back!'

`x == dog`, return 'pass out from excitement y times' (where y is the value given for y).

**Solution:**
```r
present <- function(x, y){
  if (x=="goodpresent"){
    return(intToUtf8(utf8ToInt(x)+y))
  } else if (x %in% c("crap","empty")){
    chr <- c()
    for (i in 1:nchar(x)){
      chr[i] <- substring(x,i,i)
    }
    return(paste(sort(chr),collapse=""))
  } else if (x=="bang"){
    return(as.character(sum(utf8ToInt(x)-y)))
  } else if (x=="badpresent"){
    return("Take this back!")
  } else if (x=="dog"){
    return(paste("pass out from excitement ", y, " times", sep=""))
  }
}
```

*Note*
- Maybe I'm not good at English, the descriptions seem a little terrible for me.


**The better solutions:**
```r
# by @depial
present <- function(x, y){
 switch(x,
        "goodpresent" = paste(intToUtf8(utf8ToInt(x)+y), collapse=''),
        "badpresent"  = "Take this back!",
        "crap"        = "acpr",
        "empty"       = "empty",
        "bang"        = as.character(sum(utf8ToInt(x) - y)),
        "dog"         = sprintf('pass out from excitement %d times', y))
}
```

```r
# by @ejini战神, @RGgg
present <- function(x, y){
  if(x == "badpresent"){
    'Take this back!'
  } else if(x == "dog"){
    paste("pass out from excitement", y, "times")
  } else if(x == 'crap' || x == 'empty'){
    paste(sort(unlist(strsplit(x, ""))), collapse = "")
  } else if(x == 'bang'){
    toString(sum(mapply(function(a){utf8ToInt(a) - y}, x)))
  } else{
    paste(mapply(function(a){intToUtf8(utf8ToInt(a) + y)}, x), collapse = "")
  }
}
```

# 7. composite + prime characters <a name="prob7"></a>
**Beta Kata**
Thank you for trying this beta kata. Once you've completed it, please rate how satisfied you are with this kata and rank it. Katas can only get out of beta if they are rated very satisfied. If you don't give it a very satisfied rating, share your reasons for keeping the kata in beta in a comment as a suggestion or issue. Once the suggestion or issue is resolved, please re-rate as very satisfied. Note that a kata that is too easy or too hard should not be given a lower satisfaction rating, but given a kyu ranking that matches the kata's difficulty.

**Prime and Composite Characters**
If we number the characters in a string, starting with 1, the prime characters of a string are those characters that are prime numbered, and the compose characters are the characters that are composite numbered

```
 123456
"hello "

# prime characters
 235
"elo"

# composite characters
 46
"l "

# remember, 1 is neither prime nor composite
```

**Your task**
Write the function `cpchars(s)` that takes `s` a string (in R, a character vector of length 1), and returns a re-ordered string, with the composite characters first, then the prime characters (with no separating character).

**Examples:**
```r
cpchars("Hello world!") 
[1] "l orl!elowd"

cpchars("a")
[1] ""

cpchars(" 23 5 7   ")
[1] "     2357"
```

**Solutions:**
```r
cpchars <- function(s){
  chr <- unlist(strsplit(s,""))
  if (length(chr)==1){
    return("")
  } else if (length(chr)==2) {
    return(chr[2])
  } else if (length(chr)>=3) {
    chr <- chr[-1]
    pc <- c("p")
    for (i in 2:length(chr)){
      pc[i] <- "p"
      for (j in 1:(i-1)) {
        if (((i+1) %% 2)==0){
          pc[i] <- "c"
          break
        } else if (((i+1) %% (j+1))==0){
          pc[i] <- "c"
          break
        }
      }
    }
    paste0(paste0(chr[pc=="c"],collapse=""),paste0(chr[pc=="p"],collapse=""),collapse="")
  }
}
```
