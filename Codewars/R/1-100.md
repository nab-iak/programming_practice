# 1. Convert a Number to a String! <a name="prob1"></a>
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?
Examples (input --> output):

```
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```

Answer:

```r
number_to_string <- function(n) {
  as.character(n)
}
```

# 2. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'<a name="prob2"></a>
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a `"Yes"` string for `true`, or a `"No"` string for `false`.

Answer:

```r
bool_to_word <- function(bool){
  return(ifelse(bool,"Yes","No"))
}
```

# 3. Are You Playing Banjo? <a name="prob3"></a>
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
```

Answer:

```r
are_you_playing_banjo <- function(name){
 return(
   ifelse(
   substring(name,1,1) %in% c("R","r"),
   paste(name, "plays banjo", sep=" "),
   paste(name, "does not play banjo", sep=" "))
 )
}
```
